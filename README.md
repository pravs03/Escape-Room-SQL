This project was created as part of the CFG Intro to Data & SQL Kickstarter course.

The SQL database simulates an Escape Room company, inspired by a recommended SQL project idea. It efficiently manages information about rooms, players, and booking sessions streamlining the process of scheduling and tracking activities.

# This repository contains:
* An EER diagram
* SQL code (along with a backup)
* Documentation of the tasks completed and their corresponding results
